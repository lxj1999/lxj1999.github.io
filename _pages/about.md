<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I have graduated from the National University of Singapore and received a M.Sc. degree in Robotics. From 2017 to 2021, I studied at Xi'an Jiaotong University and received a B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering. I was awarded the 'Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Project (Top 1%)' to finish my undergraduate study.

My research interest includes medical device (surgical robots) and medical imaging.
