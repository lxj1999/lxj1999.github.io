<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master of Science(Robotics) student at the National University of Singapore. During my research assistant period at Xi'an Jiaotong University, I worked with Prof. Liuyang Zhang in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. From 2017 to 2021, I studied at Xi'an Jiaotong University and received a B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering.

My research interest includes medical robots and medical imaging.
